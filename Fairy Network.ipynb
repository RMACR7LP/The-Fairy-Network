    "One of the most beloved cartoons of the last couple of decades is the Fairly Odd Parents. This show follows the adventures of Timmy Turner, your regular 10 year old kid, and his fairy godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, who grant most of his wishes using their magic. The storyline of the majority of episodes revolves around a particular wish Timmy asks for, leading to unexpected and humorous consequences. Something that characterized the show in my opinion was the wide variety of relevant and amusing characters that make up the \"Fairly OddParents Universe\", even just considering season 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this I thought it would be interesting to build a network between these characters the connected them in a meaningful way. I had seen this done for novels using proximity within the text; if character A and character B were not that far apart in the text, they would become connected. I figured I could do something similar using the transcript of the show, however a much better idea came to mind ones I saw one of the transcripts in the Fairly OddParents Fandom wiki: since transcripts are esentially dialogues of the characters, I could use this to determine when a particular character referenced another one, or roughly speaking when two characters are talking to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code aims to build a network through this heuristic using all episodes of the first season of the show. Moreover, once the network is constructed, we will perform some network analysis to explore how rich the structure becomes by using the rule of connectivity and to see if there are interesting conclusions that might be under the surface.

    "The distribution seems to follow a power-law distribution which is one of the most common patterns in graph applications; most nodes are of low degree and as the degree increases the fewer the nodes with such degree. Moreover, there is a single character (Timmy) with a much higher degree than the rest of the characters in the network, which is again something relatively common in applications. In fact, this behaviour coupled with Cosmo and Wanda having a much higher degree than other characters is to be expected as they are the true main characters of the show.\n",

    "Let us recall briefly what each of these coefficients mean and give insight on the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Degree Centrality\n",
    "\n",
    "The degree centrality is somewhat of a reflection of the degree distribution, as discussed earlier Timmy, Cosmo and Wanda are the nodes with highest degrees, which is not surprising since they are the main characters. Other than the degree distribution, the degree centrality really doesn't provide much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Betweenness Centrality\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall betweenness centrality aims to represent the extent to which each node lies on paths between other nodes. Again, Timmy is the highest in this centrality measure, however this time Timmy's measure is significantly higher than Cosmo's or Wanda's or for any other node for that matter. This makes sense since Timmy is the only real pathway (at least in this season) between Fairy World and the real world. Thus, even if Cosmo and Wanda are in the spotlight in terms of presence, they hardly interact with other non-magical characters and therefore their betweenness centrality is not as great. Furthermore, notice the great deal of practically 0 betweenness centralities. This can be explained by the fact that a great deal of characters in this season restrict their appearance to a single episode, which translates to them not being an excellent pathway between different characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Eigenvector Centrality\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvector centrality can be a little tricky to think in simple terms as it is more abstract due to being tied to the notion of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in linear algebra. To break it down as clean and concise as possible, recall that a graph can have a matrix representation called an \"adjacency matrix\" where connections between nodes are encoded in the entries. If we denote by $A$ the adjacency matrix of the network and $\\textbf{x} = (x_1, \\cdots, x_n)^T$ is an eigenvector of $A$ then \n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "(A\\textbf{x})_i &= \\lambda x_i\\\\\n",
    "\\implies \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\sum_j a_{ij}x_j &= x_i\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning that the $i$-th entry of $\\textbf{x}$ is a weighted average of all coordinates of $\\textbf{x}$ using the weight of connections $a_{ij}$ from node $i$ to all nodes $j$. Thus, if $\\textbf{x}$ were to encode a type of centrality measure for each of the nodes in the network, then the centrality measure of node $i$ depends on the centrality measure of all nodes connected to $i$. There is a mathematical result that allows us to plausibly think of $\\textbf{x}$ in such a way. However, the essence of this notion is that a node's importance (eigenvector centrality) depends on the importance of the nodes it is connected to. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, it is again obvious why Timmy has the greatest eigenvector centrality... HOWEVER! Notice that in this case Timmy is not leaps and bounds above everyone else as in the two previous centralities. After all, since most characters are connected to Timmy, Wanda and or Cosmo, in a sense they all get some shed of importance. Which could also explain for example why \"Cleft\" (which is just Timmy's superhero alter ego) has such low eigenvector centrality, since Timmy wouldn't really interact with himself as Cleft.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "The clustering coefficient of a node $i$ is a measure of how many (connected) triangles contain node $i$ relative to the number of connected triplets centered at $i$. Which intuitively translates to how close neighbors of $i$ are to being a complete graph. Here, Timmy is certainly not a contender for the node with the highest clustering coefficient, after all most shortest paths go through Timmy and are of length 2, which makes Timmy the center of many connected triplets, yet Fairy World and the real world are not highly interrelated, which makes various of those connected triplets not connected triangles. \n",
    "\n",
    "One would expect therefore that for those characters that have a single appearance the clustering coefficient would be high as it is more likely that the number of triangles is similar to the number of connected triplets centered at each character. And this would indeed be the case if we were not considering the weights of the connections of the graph. In the weighted case however, the number of triangles containing the node in question is replaced by the sum of geometric means of the normalized weights of such triangles:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "c_i = \\frac{\\sum_{j,k}(\\hat{w}_{jk}\\hat{w}_{ji}\\hat{w}_{ik})^{1/3}}{deg(i)\\cdot (deg(i)-1)}, \\hspace{1 cm} \\hat{w}_{jk} := \\frac{w_{jk}}{\\max(w)}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, the clustering coefficients in the graph tend to be relatively low either for a reason similar to Timmy's clustering coefficient being low, or because the normalized weights of the connections of a node are small compared to the \"strongest\" connection in the graph $\\max(w)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighted vs Unweighted\n",
    "At this point it is important to note that not all of the centralities above take into account the weight of the edges in the graph. Even though there are adaptations to the weighted case, the interpration of such weights varies application through application. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we were to consider a weighted graph for the betweenness centrality, the weights would represent the cost of moving from one node to the other. Since the weights of our graph have to do with the recurrence of reference, the weighted case of the betweenness centrality would not have been approppriate. Perhaps there may be a way to transform the weight in order capture a better interpretation, something along the lines of \"the higher the weight of the edge, the faster you go from one node to another\", and use the reciprocal of such weights to compute the formula of the centrality, but for the sake of simplicity we just decided to stick with the unweighted version. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, in the case of eigenvector centrality as well as the clustering coefficient, the weighted version of the formulas aligns well with the interpretation that high weights means \"more connected\" o \"more easily connected\"."

    "# Community Detection\n",
    "To conclude, we will make use of the notion of modularity to create a partition of the graph where each element of the partition is called a community. The modularity is a measure of the density of links inside communities. Thus, through the optimization of modularity we are able to find the \"best\" partition of a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us give the general idea behind modularity. Suppose we fixed the nodes of our network $G$, and consider all possible networks $G'$ that have the same nodes and preserve the same degree for each node. A way to think how a network $G'$ could be built is by assuming every node $i$ has $deg(i)$ \"half-edges\" coming out of it, each of which can be \"tied\" to another \"half-edge\" (even one coming out of the same node $i$) to form a proper edge. This way, the same nodes are being used, and the degree of each node stays the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's take a look at a pair of nodes $i$ and $j$, and consider a half edge of $i$. This half-edge could connect to a half-edge of node $j$ in $deg(j)$ different ways. If there were $E$ total edges in $G$ (so that there are $2E$ half-edges total) the probability that this half-edge does indeed connect to a half edge of node $j$ would be $\\frac{deg(j)}{2E-1}$. Now this holds for every half edge of node $i$, meaning that on average the number of half-edges of $i$ connected to a half-edge of node $j$ is $deg(i)\\cdot\\frac{deg(j)}{2E - 1}$. Using this, we could examine how much $G$ deviates from this expected outcome by the quantity\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\Delta_{ij} = a_{ij} - \\frac{deg(i)deg(j)}{2E - 1}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "where $a_{ij}$ is the $(i,j)$-entry of $A$, the adjacency matrix of $G$. If this quantity were to be positive, one could loosely interpret that nodes $i$ and $j$ are more strongly connected in $G$ than they would \"by chance\". Thus, a way to find the sought communities would be to look for groups (communities) $C_1, C_2, \\cdots C_k $ of pairs of nodes that maximize\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Q = \\sum_{(i,j)\\in C_1}\\Delta_{ij} + \\sum_{(i,j)\\in C_2}\\Delta_{ij} + \\cdots + \\sum_{(i,j)\\in C_k}\\Delta_{ij}\n",
    "\\end{equation*} \n",
    "\n",
    "By using the Kronecker's delta function to detect whether two nodes belong to the same community and replacing $2E-1$ for $2E$ (they are similar when $E$ is large) then we get a cleaner version of the above expression which is a common definition for modularity:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "Q = \\sum_{(i,j)}\\bigg(a_{ij} - \\frac{deg(i)deg(j)}{2E}\\bigg)\\delta(c_i, c_j)\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "where $c_i$ is the community node $i$ belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, by maximizing $Q$ one finds the best communities. A common way to do this is via an algorithm called the \"Louvain method for community detection\" which is conveniently present as a function of the module networkx.algorithms.community"

    "# Conclusions and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "As an all time fan of this cartoon, I certainly had some information that painted a clearer picture on the data that was considered. For instance, I knew that it was forbidden by \"Da Rules\" that Timmy let some other person from earth know that he had Fairly God Parents, which was pretty descriptive in the betweenness centralities of the network. Similarly, the performance of the Louvain method for community detection was so exciting because as a spectator these groups of characters indeed make sense from an intuitive perspective as I described earlier.\n",

    "Nevertheless, the data alone gives a great overview on the social dynamics within the show, so much so that I believe a superficial web search on the show coupled with this analysis can give a decent understanding of everything. It is quite impressive that all of this can be captured by a somewhat naive approach (reference of characters), where non-verbal cues and content within dialogues are not being taken into account. \n",

    "Regarding the reference of characters, it would be interesting to make an analogous analysis taking the directed version of the network. The point of using reference was a way to capture interaction between characters, more than an actual reference from a character A to a character B. However, it may raise interesting results and questions if this exercise is repeated through that perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel to this, something that may have not been captured through this approach is that there are some relevant characters that don't actually talk but rather interact in non-verbal ways. Popular cases of this are Kenny from South Park, Maggie from the Simpsons or Hector Salamanca from Breaking Bad. In this particular case there is an episode where a goat named Chompy plays a major role in the storyline. However, since it never spoke it was not considered as a potential character. As a much less important, yet immensely ammusing case, we also have Philip, Cosmo's female nickel, which is referenced to on several occasions in more than one episode! Getting a list of characters may not require the transcript, maybe some techniques of web scraping may be enough to get a list of potential characters that can take these cases into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, relevant groups of characters in a cartoon may overlap. For instance, given the nature of the show Timmy would have fit intuitively well in more than one of the communities given by the Louvain method. However, since this algorithm gives a partition of the nodes, it was necessary that Timmy was in a single group. In a show as rich as The Fairly Odd Parents in terms of the social dynamics, it would be quite interesting to explore overlapping community detection methods to achieve groupings that better represent the interplay of the characters.\n",
