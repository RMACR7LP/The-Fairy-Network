Carolers: (Singing) On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me, a partridge in a pear tree...
[Throughout the town, Christmas lights and decorations everywhere on streets and storefronts as people scurry back and forth as they shop. In the TV Hut, dozens of TVs are tuned to the same channel as some people scurry back and forth in front of the display. The camera pushes in on one of the TV, showing Chet Ubetcha.]

Chet Ubetcha: Yes, with the partridge in a pear tree shortage over, it’s Christmas time again. Good evening, Dimmsdale, it's Christmas and I'm Chet Ubetcha.
[The Mayor hangs Christmas lights before lightening up on the Christmas tree. A jackhammer builds the statue.]

Chet Ubetcha: (offscreen) Yes, Christmas! Better than Easter! More loving than Valentine's Day! And nowhere near as useless as Arbor Day!
[The three big statues of The Easter Bunny, Cupid, and a big tree guy are smashed and replaced by a bigger statue of Santa Claus.]

Chet Ubetcha: ...even the bitterest of enemies have put their differences aside...
[A postman with ripped pants and a dog carrying his pants squares off until the postman hands the dog a wrapped bone. The dog gives the policeman a new pair of pants.]

Chet Ubetcha: ...as everyone anxiously prepares for the arrival of Santy Claus...
[A kid stands on the roof of his house, putting up landing lights and a parking space for Santa.]

Chet Ubetcha: I'm Chet Ubetcha saying, I Ho, Ho, Hope you have a Merry Christmas.
[The camera pulls back to see the TV in the living room as Timmy looks at the TV. Then, Timmy, dressed as an elf, stands in the middle of an enormous pile of wrapped fruitcakes as presents as he finishes wrapping the last one. Cosmo and Wanda are stand nearby as green and pink presents.]

Timmy: (angrily) Ugh! (kicks the gift)
Wanda: What's wrong, Timmy?
Timmy: "Merry Christmas", Cosmo? I'll bet he never had to spend Christmas Eve with Vicky!
Vicky: (enters with a pile of fruitcakes) Hey, Frosty the Snow twerp, got some more fruitcakes for you to wrap!
[She drops the heavy load on Timmy and happily prances offscreen. Cosmo and Wanda POOF! into their normal selves.]

Wanda: Come on, Sport. Cheer up.
Timmy: I can't, Wanda! Every Christmas Eve, I'm stuck doing whatever Vicky tells me to do.
Cosmo: I know! (creates an igloo out of the fruitcakes) Remember last Christmas when she sold you and your friends as ice sculptures?
[Flashback to previous Christmas, Vicky stands on the shoulder of a busy freeway, next to a big ‘Ice Sculptures for Sale’ sign, where Timmy, Chester and A.J. are frozen solid, encased in ice. Next to her. Mr. Turner pulls up next to the display.]

Mr. Turner: Oooh! I'll take the Chester and A.J. ice sculptures! Timmy will love these! (Hands cash to Vicky and drives away as Timmy watches helplessly.)
Timmy: ...so cold... (the ice shatters and he makes a break for it) I'm free! (runs a bit, but Vicky throws water to him and freezes solid in a running pose) So cold...
[Back in living room, Timmy finishes talking to Cosmo and Wanda.]

Timmy: Man, every Christmas Eve, my parents are out shopping, and I'm stuck here with Vicky. (walks sadly, then looks at the calendar on the wall and rips December 24 to December 25) But it's worth it. Because tomorrow is Christmas! The greatest day ever!
Wanda: INCOMING!
[POOF! They turn into stockings, hanging on the fireplace. Vicky drives in on a forklift, carrying one huge fruitcake and drops it on Timmy.]

Vicky: That's the last one.
Timmy: Who are all these gifts for?
Vicky: (tosses wrapped fruitcakes into the blazing fire) Nobody! I just like making you work!
[Suddenly, a huge bag drops in through the chimney putting out the fire. Mrs. Turner drops in after it and lands on top as she wears a big Christmas sweater.]

Mrs. Turner: Merry Christmas, Timmy!
Mr. Turner: (drops down the chimney, also in a Christmas sweater) We're HO HO HOME!
Mrs. Turner and Mr. Turner: (laughs)
Mr. Turner: Oh, I'm with the spirit.
[Mrs. Turner and Mr. Turner stand together, and their sweaters form a white image of a reindeer, happily flying from one shirt to the other.]

Vicky: (charmed) Merry Christmas, Mr. and Ms. Turner! Is it time for my Christmas bonus?
Mr. Turner: Yep! This year, you get to leave early!
[Timmy rolls Vicky out the door on a refrigerator dolly.]

Mrs. Turner: Bye, Vicky!
[Vicky is thrown out and is covered in snow.]

A.J.: Wow, a Vicky snowman!
[Chester lights up a torch.]

Timmy: (breaks free from the fruitcake covering and is not in his elf costume) Vicky's gone!
Mrs. Turner: Which means it's time to decorate the house! (reaches over to a small statue of William Shakespeare's head and pulls it open, revealing a button)
[Mr. Turner hits the button. Suddenly, hidden panels on the wall, ceiling and floor open, revealing Christmas decorations springing out everywhere throughout the house, including a Christmas tree.]

Timmy: (sighs happily) All right! Tomorrow's Christmas! Uh, you don't have to work, or shop, or do anything that would make you bring Vicky back here, right?
Mrs. Turner: No. All we have to do tomorrow is be with you, Timmy!
Mr. Turner: And drink eggnog! (pauses) I mean, be with you, Noggy!
[The next morning, Timmy is at his window as the outside is still dark with moon and stars.]

Timmy: (waits) Come on... come on... [The sun barely peeks one light ray over the sky, then the sun finally comes up with a Christmas wreath around it.] IT'S CHRISTMAS! IT'S CHRISTMAS! Merry Christmas!
[Cosmo and Wanda poof up Santa hats and candy canes in their fishbowl. Seconds later, Mr. and Mrs. Turner are still asleep in their bedroom.]

Mr. Turner: (cuddles with an empty carbon of eggnog and snores) Egg (snores) Nog... (snores) Eggnog....
Timmy: (kicks the door open offscreen and leaps to Mr. and Mrs. Turner in their bed) MERRY CHRISTMAS!
Mr. Turner: (half asleep, whips the carton behind his back) MINE! I mean MINE.. EY CHRISTMAS, Timmy!
Timmy: Come on! Come on! Let's go see what Santa brought!
[Timmy runs out as Mr. Turner follows. Mrs. Turner looks around, sees the springboard, leaps onto it and flips offscreen. Timmy runs up to the railing and looks over the balcony into the living room.]

Timmy: (hypnotized) Whoa! It's amazing... and I don't have to share any of this! I love being an only child! (Sees presents flooding throughout the entire living room as Mr. and Mrs. Turner sidle up to Timmy) GERONIMO! (dives)
Mr. Turner: (Mrs. Turner smiles at Mr. Turner and turns away quickly, while holding an eggnog) Mine!
[Timmy comes up to the surface in a Wanda submarine. The hatch pops up and Timmy rises, shirtless, while wearing a cowboy hat. Cosmo as a helicopter arrives as they smiled next to him.]

Timmy and Cosmo: I love the smell of Christmas in the morning!
Wanda: DIVE DIVE DIVE!
[They all dive into the toys as the song "I Wish Every Day Could Be Christmas" starts to play.]

Timmy: Christmas Day is here once more!
Wanda: Gifts and Love and Joy galore!
Cosmo: A special day that wipes the floor…
Timmy, Cosmo, and Wanda: With the other three hundred and sixty four!
Timmy: I wish every day could be Christmas. 'Cuz Santa brings gifts every year! (as a Santa is getting the sleigh ready looking at a Wish List) He's reading my list, he's feeding the deer... he's hauling my gifts......from the North Pole to here! (paints a big ‘X marks the spot’ under the tree) I wish every day could be Christmas! ‘Cause every other holiday reeks! New Year's Eve's for Mom and Dad! The Easter Bunny's eggs smell really bad! Valentine's Day always makes me sad!
Mr. Turner: (pops in) Cause Timmy just can't get a girlfriend!
Timmy: What?!
Cosmo: I wish every day could be Christmas! 'Cuz Nice fairies get their rewards!
Wanda: I got pudding! I got slacks!
Cosmo: I got all my back hair waxed!
Cosmo and Wanda: Santa grants wishes while we relax!
Cosmo: And Timmy just can’t get a girlfriend!
Timmy: Stop that!
Timmy: There's just no other day like Christmas... my family stays here, it's real cool... just me, Mom and Dad... I'm so very glad, there's no Vicky, no Vicky, no school...
Cosmo: ...and no Vicky!
Timmy: Right!
Timmy: (drifting to sleep) I wish every day could be Christmas! Then I'd get the best gift of all! My parents stay home to say...
Mr. Turner and Mrs. Turner: We love you, Noggy...!
Mr. Turner: (turns quickly and runs away) MINE!
[The song "I Wish Every Day Could Be Christmas" ended.]

Timmy: Wouldn't Christmas each day be the coolest of all? I wish every day could be Christmas... How I wish it were Christmas... (drowsily) I wish it were Christmas... (snores, sings off key) each day! (drifts off to sleep)
[Cosmo and Wanda poof into their fishbowl and share a nervous look.]

Cosmo: Well... he said, "I wish."
Wanda: I know...
[The clock radio changes from 12:00 AM to 12:01 AM.]

Wanda: I just wish he didn't!
[Cosmo and Wanda wave their wands and a poof cloud appears with the lettering UH-OH! The next morning, Timmy looks at the window as the sky is still dark. The sun barely peeks one light-ray over the horizon and the sun finally comes up with the Christmas wreath around it again.]

Timmy: (cheers) IT’S CHRISTMAS! (pauses) AGAIN!
[Seconds later, Mr. and Mrs. Turner are still sound asleep.]

Mr. Turner: (cuddles with an empty carton of eggnog again) Egg... (snores) Nog... (snores) Eggnog...
Timmy: (kicks the door open offscreen and leaps to Mr. and Mrs. Turner in their bed) MERRY CHRISTMAS! AGAIN!
Mrs. Turner: But, honey, you have to go to school, and we have to go to work.
Timmy: No, you don't! Look! (points out the window and we see the same group of Christmas carolers on the street, singing)
Carolers: On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me... two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree...
[Mr. and Mrs. Turner look out the window at another part of the street. Timmy flips “Monday, Dec. 25th to “Tuesday, Dec. 25th”.]

Mrs. Turner: Well... okay.
Mr. Turner: The calendar's never lied to me yet.
[Timmy throws them on the springboard, and they flip offscreen. Same as before Mr. and Mrs. Turner lands on the railing, on their stomachs/ They look out over the living room and see toys flooded through the living room.]

Timmy: See? Santa came! Again! It's Christmas! Again! (leaps over the railing into the sea of toys) GERONIMO! AGAIN!
[At the sea of wrapped gifts, Cosmo, Wanda and Timmy at the boat, catches the gift.]

Timmy: Cosmo! Wanda! You did it! It's Christmas again!
Cosmo: Well, that was one big wish you made, sport!
Wanda: But there's something we really should tell you...
Timmy: (squealing with delight) I've never been happier!
[Timmy hugs Cosmo and Wanda.]

Timmy: (cuts open a fish that reveals presents inside it) So, what were you gonna say?
Cosmo: Uh… DIVE! DIVE! DIVE! (poofs Timmy into his scuba diving gear)
[Timmy happily disappears into the sea of toys. Then at night, Mr. and Mrs. Turner tuck Timmy, wearing a Santa hat into bed. A toy train set travels across his bed, but then falls off the track and crashes off-screen.]

Mrs. Turner: We hope you enjoyed your second day of Christmas, Timmy.
Timmy: These have been the best two Christmases ever! Wouldn't it be great if we could be together like this all the time?
Mr. Turner: It sure would, Timmy, but your mother and I have to work! Eggnog doesn't buy itself; you know. (smothers the eggnog container and baby-talks to it) No, you don't.
Mrs. Turner: If it kept being Christmas, I just don't know what we'd do!
Mr. Turner: (panicky) We'd probably panic! (calmly) Oh, well, goodnight. (shuts the door)
[Cosmo and Wanda in the fishbowl, grows unease, while Timmy smiles and looks at the calendar, reading December 25th. A page flies off, and the page below it also reads, December 25th. The next day, Mr. and Mrs. Turner are asleep.]

Timmy: (psyched) It's Christmas!
Mr. and Mrs. Turner: Again?
[They wake abruptly as Timmy’s hands yanks them out of bed. The calendar reads December 25th again, then the page with the same day along with bottom page. As the same day past by, a huge amount of snow is now piled up past the first-floor windows.]

Timmy: (offscreen) It's Christmas!
Mr. and Mrs. Turner: (bewildered) Again? (lands by the railing again)
Timmy: (dives over the railing again) Geronimo! (falls) Ugh! (lands next to a smaller puddle of toys) Hey! This is a toy puddle! Where's my toy ocean?
[POOF! Cosmo and Wanda appear next to Timmy as toys.]

Wanda: (as a doll) Well, you know, Timmy, I'm sure Santa's doing the best he can.
Cosmo: (as Jack in the Box toy) He's never had to make toys for this many Christmases before.
Mr. Turner: (walks to the front door) Well, honey, if we're going to have a fourth day of Christmas, I have to get more eggnog. And I'm good with that! [Opens the door and a large amount of snow blocks his way as it pours into the house. A large dog leaps out of nowhere and pulls him out of the snowdrift.] Oh, thanks, Lockjaw! (turns the faucet handle on the tiny barrel around the dog’s neck and a carton of eggnog pops out) Alright! Nog! (drinks the eggnog)
[The camera pans through downtown Dimmsdale. Every building is buried in snow as snow is still falling. The Christmas Carolers stand on top of a gazebo, which is also buried in snow.]

Carolers: (singing unenthusiastically) It's the fifteenth day of Christmas and my true love gave to me... (they shrug) ...Pants? Yeah, pants... Okay...
[A city snowplow barrels past and completely buries the carolers with snow. The snowplow lumbers down the street, passing Timmy, who rides a dogsled, which is being pulled by Cosmo and Wanda, who are disguised as pink and green huskies.]

Cosmo: Wow, fifteen Christmases and counting.
Timmy: (questioning the wisdom and is still psyched) I know. This is the best! (pauses) Right?
Chet Ubetcha (offscreen): This is the worst!
[As Timmy stops the dogsled, they look at the store window filled with TVs as Chet Ubetcha appears on TV screen.]

Chet Ubetcha: It’s Ho Ho Horrible!!! (miserably) As Christmas enters its third week, the world screams: ‘Christmas is entering its third week!’
[On the bank, where it's closed, people pound on the doors using a giant candy cane as a battering ram.]

Chet Ubetcha (offscreen): Because it's still Christmas, the banks are still closed!
All: We want money!
Mr. Turner: To buy eggnog!
[On Foodmart, which is also closed, people pound on the doors using Mr. Turner as a battering ram.]

Chet Ubetcha (offscreen): Stores are closed!
All: We want food!
Mr. Turner: And eggnog! To buy!
[On Dimmsdale Elementary School, it is also closed.]

Chet Ubetcha (offscreen): And the schools remain closed.
Chester: (calmly rides by on a skateboard) I'm good with this.
[We see various people boarding up their chimneys.]

Chet Ubetcha: Everywhere, adults are doing all that they can to prevent yet another visit from Santa...
Chet Ubetcha: ...and the military forces across the globe remain on high alert.
[A squadron of heavily armed troops in tanks with anti-aircraft guns scan the sky.]

General: (yells into a walkie-talkie) Deploy the decoy chimney!
[A huge chimney, bedecked with Christmas lights, rises from a hidden silo in the sand. One soldier puts a wreath on the decoy chimney.]

General: Release the cookies and milk!
[A pitcher of milk and a plate of cookies rise up next to the chimney.]

General: Everyone, pretend to be asleep!
[The soldiers rip off their uniforms, revealing pajamas underneath. Then, they all hit the deck, snoring.]

Soldier #1: I hope I get a football!
Santa: (in his sleigh, spots the cookies) Mmmm...cookies!
[He guides the reindeer towards the chimney. The chimney splits open, revealing a massive radar dish-shaped laser blaster fires laser beams as Santa dodges explosions all around him.]

Santa: What is the matter with you people! I'm just doing my job! (his sleigh screams off over the horizon)
Chet Ubetcha: As the world falls apart at the seams, people everywhere are asking: Who is responsible for this and how can we tear them limb from limb?
[On Timmy, Cosmo, Wanda, watching the TV screen.]

Timmy: Uh, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Cosmo: Yeah! (as he and Wanda poof back to normal) He's cute when he's angry!
Timmy: That may be true, but I think the world has had enough Christmas for one year. I wish it wasn't Christmas anymore.
Wanda: Uh... we can't do that Timmy. We don't have enough power!
Timmy: What do you mean?
[Suddenly, a pink bunny paw reaches out from the shadows and yanks Timmy into an alley. Timmy is slammed against a wall. Several shadows circled Timmy as he looks up.]

Timmy: What's going on? Who are you, guys?!
The Easter Bunny: I'm the Easter Bunny.
[Several other holidays mascots: Baby New Year, Cupid, Hallo-weenie, and The April Fool menacingly surrounds Timmy.]

The Easter Bunny: These are the other holidays. And you are in a lot of trouble, kid.
