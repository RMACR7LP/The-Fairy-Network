Timmy (scared): I'm in trouble? What did I do?
The Easter Bunny: Your stupid ‘Christmas every day’ wish means the rest of us holidays don't get to deliver joy to the kids of the world ever again!
[Cosmo and Wanda POOF! into scene.]

Cosmo: Who are you brightly colored freaks?
The Easter Bunny: I'm the Easter Bunny. That's Baby New Year!
Baby New Year: (holds the rattle and speaks in a deep booming voice) Goo!
The Easter Bunny: It's gonna be a big year. Cupid from Valentine's Day.
Cupid: Sometimes... (arrows pointed) Love hurts!
The Easter Bunny: And please give it up for the comedy styling of the April Fool.
The April Fool: (appears on stage, then holds out his hand towards Timmy) Pull my finger... AND PERISH!
[And finally, we pan over to see a dachshund with a jack o'lantern on its head and bat wings.]

The Easter Bunny: And that's Hallo-weenie Dog.
[Hallow-weenie barks and the pumpkin cracks and falls off his head.]

Timmy: That’s not the spirit of Halloween!
The Easter Bunny: Alright, he's, my dog. I just hate to travel without him. (to Hallo-weenie) Yes, I do! Yes, I do!
Wanda: (flies towards The Easter Bunny) What do you second-rate, not-Christmas holidays want with our Timmy?
The Easter Bunny: (confronts Timmy) He'd better unwish that wish or he's gonna get an egg where the sun don't shine!
Cosmo: You mean the closet?
Wanda: But there's nothing we can do! We don’t have enough magic left!
Timmy: What?!
Wanda: Timmy, there's something you didn't know when you made your wish...
[At Fairy World, dozens of fairies fire their magic up through the clouds to the North Pole.]

Wanda: (voiceover) ...Giving gifts to everyone in the world takes a lot of magic, so every Christmas eve...
[A tiny little cottage is next to an enormous corporate structure and factory attached to it, complete with satellite array, helipad and guard towers. In big Christmassy letters, a sign reads ‘Kringle Inc.’ A blast of magic zaps into the satellite dish on top of the building. Inside the building, several elves are making hi-tech toys. Then, the camera stops on Santa, now thin, tan, with a white goatee and wearing grey suit and tie, sits in front of a computer, wearing a headset phone.]

Wanda (voiceover): All us fairies in Fairy World get together and transfer most of our magic to the one man on Earth that needs it the most… Santa Claus!
Santa: Well, I don't care. It's “Ho! Ho! Ho!” not “Ho! Ho! Who!” Fix the sign.  
[On the computer monitor, a web page with a star logo pops out.]

Computer Voice Announcer: ‘You've Got Magic!’
[A blast of magic shoots from the computer screen and engulfs Santa. His goatee grows into a large white beard, his business suit rips to reveal the classic red and white Santa outfit, and he is now fat and jolly.]

Santa: Ho Ho... Holy Mackerel! I'm jolly again! (grabs a giant sack of toys, throws it over his shoulder, and bounces offscreen)
[Back at the alleyway with Wanda and Timmy.]

Wanda: When Christmas is over, the magic comes back to us! But now, because it's Christmas every day, it won't!
Cosmo: We're practically powerless!
The Easter Bunny: Because of this kid, - [Hides an Easter egg in a nearby can] it's always gonna be Christmas!
The April Fool: Which means we don't get to share our holidays with the kids! What's up with that?
Timmy: I just wanted more toys and to spend more time with my mom and dad! (feels sad) And now everybody's so sick of Christmas, they even want to get rid of Santa.
Cupid: He's right! As long as Santa's around, this could happen again.
The Easter Bunny: Right! All we need to do is banish Santa to the imaginary day of February 33rd and get rid of him for good! But to do that, we'll need a little magic. [Baby New Year grabs Cosmo and Wanda.] ...And you two are a little magic.
[The April Fool pulls up in his bus. The holiday mascots pile in, except for Baby New Year, who sits on top of the bus, still holding Cosmo and Wanda in each hand.]

Horn: I'll be here all week! I'll be here all week!
The Easter Bunny: Okay! Let’s get hopping'!
[The car, overloaded with holidays, peels out offscreen.]

Timmy: Santa's in trouble and it's all my fault! I've gotta get to the North Pole.
[Later in the living room, Timmy sits in his sea of toys. He cranks a Jack in the Box, and a boxing glove pops out and smacks him in the face.]

Timmy: Ugh, this is hopeless! There's nothing here that'll help me get to the North Pole!
Mr. Turner: (offscreen) Darn it! (next to the pile of toys) ...I've looked under this high-speed snowmobile, portable power generator, all this survival gear, a detailed map from our house to the North Pole, so simple that even a 10-year-old child could read, and I can't find the eggnog anywhere!
[Timmy looks at the snow mobile and smiles as he looks at the list. In the garage, Timmy’s snowmobile is packed, and he’s dressed to leave. He hops on the snowmobile and starts it up.]

Timmy: This trip could be potentially dangerous. Even life threatening. Cool! But in case I don't die, I better have a back-up plan... (taps away on his wireless Internet system) Santa's in trouble and I'm off to the North Pole to help...
[A map with a red line, moves north from Dimmsdale towards the Canadian Border.]

Timmy: (voiceover) ...If you see me, wish me luck. And-and help me! Don't just stand there and stare, help me! HELP ME! Merry Christmas again. Timmy Turner.
[Electronic signals spread from Dimmsdale to various spots around the globe. At Butte, Montana, the place is buried in snow.]

Timmy: (on the snowmobile, writes in a logbook) Timmy's log: Star date: Christmas. Feels like I've been gone for weeks. But at this speed, I'll be there in no time. [The snowmobile slowly putters to a stop.] I'm out of gas!
Maria: (rides on a horse) Welcome to Butte! The gas capital of Montana. Got your message on the Internet, Timmy Turner. Think it's mighty fine what you're doing for Santa. (hands him a gigantic can of gas) Merry Christmas! Or as we say in Montana, you're standing' in cow manure!
Timmy: (Looking at boot) Awesome!
[The red line from the map moves north and east from Montana to Quebec. Timmy pulls into the main street of a rural Canadian town, where Christmas decorations are everywhere along with Canadian and French flags.]

Timmy: Timmy's log: Star date: Christmas. No food. So hungry. Must eat logbook...
[Timmy starts to eat his logbook when suddenly, a half dozen stereotypical French kids approach Timmy.]

French Kids: Bonjour!
French Kid #1: Are you ze one zey call Timmy Turner?
Timmy: Uh... Oui?
French Girl #1: We got your message on ze Internet! Even here in Northern Quebec!
[Each kid pulls out croissants, big sticks of bread, bottles of water and escargot.]

French Kid #2: We wish you luck in your mission!
Timmy: Merci! (giving snails back to kid) You can keep the snails.
[The red line continues to move north from Quebec to Greenland, across the Atlantic Ocean. Timmy, riding the snowmobile, putters to a stop at the edge of the frozen ocean and hops off onto the beach.]

Timmy: I made it all the way across the ocean to Greenland and nothing bad happened!
[A giant shark bursts through the ice, eats every bit of Timmy’s gear, then dives back into the water.]

Timmy: Well, that's inconvenient.
[Inside the bus, The April Fool, with the other holiday mascots crammed in the car, drive through the snow-covered landscape.]

The April Fool: Greenland! It's not Green! And there’s no land! What's up with that?
Cupid: (sharping his arrows) Just one country away from getting rid of Santa for good!
The Easter Bunny: Yeah! And then we’ll be able to create our own super holiday -- Hall... New-Easter -- Weenentine Day!
[The camera pans to the roof, where Baby New Year is still clutching Cosmo and Wanda.]

Wanda: Hall-New-Easter-Weenentine Day?
Cosmo: I didn't think you'd remember!
Cupid: Hey, who the heck is that?
[Timmy, without his pink hat, now wears a lit candle on his head and holds a sign that says, ‘Get Santa or Bust’.]

Timmy: Hi! Am I too late to get Santa?
The Easter Bunny: Who are you?
Timmy: I'm a holiday! Like you! I'm uh... Birthday Boy?
The April Fool: Hop in!
The Easter Bunny: I do the hopping' around here.
[Timmy, burning candle and all, jams into the bus. Meanwhile, a crowd of elves' pickets outside.]

Elves: No more toys for girls and boys! No more toys for girls and boys!
[The camera pans across Santa's workshop, where a wide array of hastily slapped together toys as Santa, all alone, desperately tries to fulfill each and every toy order.]

Santa: These toys stink! I'm running out of creative ideas!
[Mrs. Claus, wearing a business suit, enters and puts a concerned hand on Santa's shoulder.]

Mrs. Claus: Kris, you're working yourself to death!
Santa: I don't care, honey. As long as it's Christmas, and I've got the magic, I have to give the children what they've wished for!
[The bus pulls near Santa’s place. Timmy, as Birthday Boy, peeks up to the roof and sees Cosmo and Wanda, still being held by Baby New Year.]

Timmy: Psst! Cosmo! Wanda!
Wanda: Timmy?
Cosmo: No, Timmy has a pink hat! That's Birthday Boy.
Timmy: Listen, I've gotta to get to Santa before they do, but I'm gonna need help.
Cosmo: But we don't have any magic!
Timmy: But you do have those... (points to Cosmo and Wanda's crowns)
[A little later, The April Fool’s car sits in the center of the road with four flat tires. All the holidays, including Cosmo and Wanda who are still being held by Baby New Year, look at the damage. Baby New Year is obscured by the car.]

The Easter Bunny: Hey, these tires were flattened with two fairy Godparent crowns! (puts an Easter egg under one of the crowns) Who could have done that? (to Baby New Year) And where's your diaper?
[Cuts to Timmy riding the diaper like a sled.]

Timmy: This diaper may be stinky, but it sure is fast. I'm traveling at the speed of smell.
[Back at Santa's workshop Santa, sweating profusely, stands next to the table as he tries to use magic from his hands. Mrs. Klaus reads from a long list.]

Timmy: (bursts through the wall) Santa! We gotta get you out of here!
Santa: Who are you? And why do you smell like a dirty diaper?
Timmy: I'm Timmy Turner! I’m the dope who wished it would be Christmas every day!
Santa: Well, son, wanting peace and joy in the world each and every day is a wonderful sentiment.
Mrs. Claus: (sits at the computer, typing) But you're getting coal for the rest of your life! (presses enter)
Computer: "You've got coal!"
Timmy: (a lump of coal appears in his hand and throws it away in frustration) Fine! I don't care if I never get another decent present again! You're both in a lot of danger and...
[A big safety pin flies in from offscreen. like a boomerang and pins Timmy to the wall, wrapped in the diaper.]

Timmy: Oh no! They're here!
[Suddenly, Santa’s workshop wall explodes. Santa stares in horror as the smoke clears and he sees the other holiday mascots arrived.]

Mrs. Claus: What are you lesser holidays doing here?
The Easter Bunny: We wanna stop Christmas and we're here for the magic! Get him!
[The other holidays jump towards Santa then stops to look up and see they’re under the mistle toe.]

The Easter Bunny: Darn it. Mistletoe.
Holiday Mascots: (awkwardly shakes hands) I like you as a friend. You’re a good person.
Cupid: You’ve jingled your last bell, bub. (pulls out a dynamite arrow and fires it at Santa)
[The wall explodes and Santa flies out of the building where he lands far away in the reindeer pen. Cupid and April Fool peer out of the hole.]

Cupid: GET HIM!!!!!
[Santa raises his arms and fires a blast of Christmas Magic at the other holiday mascots. The Easter Bunny and Baby New Year, holds Cosmo and Wanda as they absorb the blast from Santa.

Wanda: Hey! They're using us like sponges to absorb the magic from Santa!
[The Easter Bunny hurls exploding eggs at Santa. Then, Santa raises his hands and produces a glowing wreath forcefield as the eggs explode, throwing Santa into a Candy Cane Forest that shatters.]

Santa: I find... no joy... in this! (fires more magic back, but more magic is absorbed to Cosmo and Wanda as he weakens and changes back into his corporate Santa form) ...losing... holiday... spirit.
The April Fool: (steps into frame, swinging his comedy microphone with a cord) He’s weakening! What’s up with that? (hurls the microphone cord offscreen)
[The microphone with wires wraps itself around Santa and yanked offscreen.]

The Easter Bunny: (drags Santa) Not so jolly now, huh, Kringle? New Year, hit me.
[Baby New Year squeezes Cosmo and Wanda with magic pouring out from them and absorbs it into The Easter Bunny.]

Timmy: Oh no!
[The Easter Bunny grows mad with power and becomes a giant. He then raises a large Easter Egg that is lit with a fuse.]

The Easter Bunny: (laughs wickedly) When this double Grade A egg explodes, it'll blow you to February 33rd! Which does not exist! Then Christmas will never come again! (winds up the giant exploding egg)
Timmy: (jumps in between the other holidays and Santa) NOOOO! Leave him alone! It's not his fault! I'll never let you hurt Santa!
The Easter Bunny: How are you gonna stop us, huh? You're just one little kid!
Maria: (offscreen) No, he ain't!
[A snail flies in from offscreen, knocking the big glowing egg out of the Easter Bunny’s hand. On a giant snow cliff, Maria sits atop her horse with other French kids from Quebec, standing next to her.]

Maria: He's just the kid who got here first.
[Her horse whinnies as an army of kids from every corner of the globe appear next to her on the snow cliff. The magnificent sunset shines behind them creating an unbelievably heroic moment.]

Timmy: Wow! It's every web-enabled kid in the world!
[The kids run down the cliffside and encircle the Holiday mascots.]

Cupid: We can't fight kids! Can we?
The Easter Bunny: No! We wanted Santa gone (hides an Easter egg under an elephant) so we could bring our own holiday specific joy to children.
The April Fool: So, they'd love us, too. That's what's up with that.
Timmy: But we do love you guys.
All Holiday mascots: Really?
The Easter Bunny: What's up with that?
The April Fool: Hey!
Timmy: Just, you know, not as much. I mean Santa brings us toys and Christmas brings our families together.
The Easter Bunny: Birthday Boy's got a point. All I do is leave eggs that go bad if you don't find 'em.
The April Fool: And all I do is get kids to play horrible pranks on one another.
Cupid: Yeah, but I make kids fall in love with each other!
Kids: Eeewww!
Cupid: Point taken.
The Easter Bunny: We're sorry, Santa. We were both stupid and jealous. (gives the magic back to Santa and Santa finally glows with magic again)
Kids: Yay, Santa!
The Easter Bunny: (shrinks down to normal size) Can you forgive us, Santa?
Santa: I don't have time to forgive you! Tomorrow's Christmas again! And as long as it's still Christmas, (pulls out a HAMMER and SAW... preparing to begin making new toys again) I have to give the kids what they wish for!
Timmy: (realizing) That's it! That's how we fix this! (to kids of the world) Do you know why it'll be Christmas again tomorrow? Because we keep telling Santa we want some toy, or doll, or some stupid thing. And Christmas day, Santa grants our wishes whatever they may be.
[On Kids as Timmy speaks.]

Timmy: (offscreen) But if every kid in the world wished for it to be the day after Christmas, that's what Santa would have to bring to us! December 26th! Quick! Everyone write Santa a letter! Tell him you wish it were the day after Christmas!
[Every kid pulls out a pencil and paper and starts scribbling furiously. The sun is sets as it starts to get dark. The reprise of the song "I Wish Every Day Could Be Christmas" starts to play. Timmy sharpens pencils, grabs letters, licks envelopes closed, and throws them in mail sacks.]

Timmy: (voiceover) I wished every day could be Christmas.
[Timmy and the other holidays, acting as a bucket brigade, throw sack after sack of mail into Santa’s workshop.]

Timmy: Jeepers, how foolish I was. It isn't a gift. It isn't a toy.
[Cosmo and Wanda are opening the letters and handing them to Mrs. Klaus. She smiles with every letter.]

Timmy: (voiceover) It's the family and friends that I really enjoy.
[The sun sets. Santa walks in and looks at Mrs. Klaus who hands Santa the letters.]

Timmy: (voiceover) I wish tomorrow wouldn’t be Christmas. But I wish that the feeling would stay.
[Santa dramatically zaps it with magic, and it changes to “December 26th”. The magic blasts out of the satellite dish and into the sky through Fairy World. Dozens of fairies look to the sky as magic rains back down upon them. They dance in the magic rain and change each other into things.]

Timmy: (shakes hands and hugs the other holidays as he sings) Cuz Christmas can always be there in your heart, and never be locked to just one single day.
[On Timmy, Cosmo, and Wanda as they have their magic back.]

Timmy: It's great that tomorrow ain't Christmas. In Dimmsdale, and London, and Rome. If I had just one wish, I think it'd be this: I really just wanna go home now. I really just wish I were home.
[The reprise of the song "I Wish Every Day Could Be Christmas" ended as Cosmo and Wanda smiles and raise wands. And with a dramatic poof, they vanish, The next morning, the snow has stopped, and the sun shines. Mr. and Mrs. Turner are asleep in their bedroom.]

Timmy: (poofs in over the bed and lands between them) Mom! Dad! Wake up! It's not Christmas anymore!
Mr. and Mrs. Turner: It's not?
[Mr. Turner turns on the TV with the remote and Chet Ubetcha is at his news desk.]

Chet Ubetcha: Yes, the endless Christmas is finally over. People across the globe are slowly returning to their everyday lives...
[The Mailman takes back the bone and the Dog rips his pants off.]

Chet Ubetcha: ...and the bitterest of enemies gladly return to being the bitterest of enemies.
Mr. and Mrs. Turner: It's a miracle! (sniffs)
Mr. Turner: What's that awful smell?
[A rotten easter egg falls out of Timmy’s pants and onto the floor.]

Mr. Turner: Hey, an egg fell out of Timmy's noggin.
Mrs. Turner: Egg... noggin...
Mr. Turner: MINE!!! (jumps and pounces onto the floor)
[In the fishbowl, Cosmo and Wanda as a goldfish, looks at Da Rules.]

Wanda: (reading) ...And furthermore, under no circumstances, is any fairy allowed to grant an ‘I wish it was Christmas Every Day’ wish ever again.
Cosmo: Wow! They've added a new rule! You really gotta mess up big time to make that happen!
Wanda: We're proud of you, Timmy!
Timmy: Thanks, guys.
Wanda: Now all we have to do is make amends to Santa for making him work so hard.
Timmy: How do we do that?
[At the sunset, the golden text reads: ‘One year later’. On Cosmo, Wanda, Baby New Year, The April Fool, Cupid and The Easter Bunny, all harnessed to Santa’s Sleigh, pulling it through the sky like reindeer. On Santa's sleigh, Timmy, dressed in his elf suit, hurriedly tosses presents out of a sack and over the side.]

The Easter Bunny: (turns to Timmy) How many houses do we have to hit?
Timmy: (panicked) All of them! (tosses a pitcher of lemonade with two glasses on the side)
[At the beach, Santa, as a business man, sits under an umbrella in a sun chair next to Mrs. Claus, wearing a stylish one-piece. The lemonade drops into Santa’s hand, then into Ms. Claus’s hand.]

Both: Merry Christmas, Noggy!
[On Cosmo and Wanda as riding as a reindeer.]

Cosmo and Wanda: Merry Christmas to all...and to all...
Timmy: ...one per year!
