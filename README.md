# The Fairy Network
A wide variety of real-world applications can be studied through network analysis: Transportation Networks, Criminal Networks, etc. The mathematics revolving around graph theory and statistics provide powerful tools to examine these types of structures and derive
conclusions from them. 

This project aims to showcase some of the techniques and machinery regularly used to approach the task of studying a network. 
Specifically, we construct a graph using naming reference in the transcripts of the first season of the popular and beloved show The Fairly OddParents. Once the network is constructed, we explore its degree distribution, centrality measures of the different characters, and even use a community detection algorithm.

This project was done in Python mainly using Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation, newtorkx for graph construction and pyvis for data visualization. For a closer look at the code and its funcitonality I suggest downloading the "Fairy Network".ipynb along with its dependencies. However, for a quick and elegant visualization it is probably beest to use the following link: https://nbviewer.org/github/RMACR7LP/The-Fairy-Network/blob/main/Fairy%20Network.ipynb
